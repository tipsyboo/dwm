My build of DWM.

WM-specific hotkeys are hardcoded into DWM; SXHKD used for everything else.

Super+Q			Quit
Super+Shift+Q		Restart DWM (via xsession kill)
Super+A			Dmenu
Super+Enter		Terminal
Super+Z			Scratchpad
Super+D			Toggle horizontal/vertical
Super+Shift+{H,L}	Adjust master/stack factor
Super+Space		Zoom
